Comparison of Transformer Models from Topological Perspective [\[Paper\]](https://david-li0406.github.io/files/dsc_214_report.pdf)
======
* Extract mention representations from the whole sentence encoding outputted by each transformer model (E.g. BERT, GPT2) and build mapper graph as the model’s topological summary; analyzed the mapper graph and determine the consistency of graph similarity between two models, corresponding to their architectural similarity.

Diff-Transferer: Any Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech with Diffusion [\[Paper\]](https://david-li0406.github.io/files/dsc291_final_project.pdf)
======
* Proposed Diff-Transferer, an any speaker text-to-speech model with a shallow diffusion mechanism; stabilized the traning process of the diffusion model and reduced the number of training steps needed to reach convergence.

NLP Research Hotspots Analysis with Structural and Unstructured Data [\[Slides\]](https://david-li0406.github.io/files/DSC202_Final_PPT_1208_.pdf)
======
* Crawled information of NLP papers in recent three years from semantic scholar API; extracted keywords from abstract of each paper and conducted unsurpervised topic clustering; analyzed the authors’ collaboration relationship with Neo4j; analyzed combination of different topics with co-occurrence heatmap.
