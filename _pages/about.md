I am Dawei Li, a first-year PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU), advised by [Prof. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Beijing Language and Cultural University (BLCU) and master's degree in Data Science from University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I had also been a research intern at Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Language Resources and AI Lab of Xiaomi. I am the founder of the opensource research community [OracleLLM](https://oracle-llm.github.io/). I am very fortunately advised by and maintain closely connected with [Prof. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/), [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) and [Dr. Yanran Li](http://yanran.li/about/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. Here are some directions my previous work covered:

* Exploring the concept of LLMs-as-Oracle, which refers to replacing human-generated golden references with the output and feedback produced by large language models (LLMs), treating them as authoritative benchmarks and learning signals for various tasks and applications such as data synthesis, LLM-as-a-judge and self-feedback.
* Benchmarking and improving the group social intelligence of LLM agent with more dynamic, complex methods, finding high-level insights to optimize multi-agent pipeline designing.
* Applying machine learning and data science methods, like adversarial training and casual inference, in NLP tasks to build more robust, trustworthy and interpretable models.
