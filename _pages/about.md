I am Dawei Li, a graduate student at Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Previously, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Beijing Language and Cultural University (BLCU). During university, I had been a research intern at Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Language Resources (ICALL) and AI Lab of Xiaomi. I am fortunately advised by and maintain closely connected with [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) and [Dr. Yanran Li](http://yanran.li/about/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. Here are some directions my previous work covered:

* Combining structured knowledge with unstructured text together to benifit downstream tasks, like dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning and knowledge graph construction.
* Exploring and exploiting additional corpus to conduct contrastive learning, especially in low-resource and weak-supervised scenarios.
* Applying machine learning methods, like adversarial training and domain adaptation, in NLP tasks to build robust and trustworthy models.

I am also interested in Large Language Models and trying to do some cool things with them.
